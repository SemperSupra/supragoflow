# Contributing

This repository is **invite-only** for Issues and Pull Requests.

- Only SemperSupra members, invited collaborators, and allowlisted automation accounts may open Issues or PRs.
- PRs from forks are **not accepted**, except from designated fork contributors.
- Allowlisted agents must work on branches in the main repository (the allowlist does not grant fork privileges).

Allowlists are managed in `.github/allowlist.yml`.

If you need access, contact the maintainers out-of-band and include your GitHub username.
